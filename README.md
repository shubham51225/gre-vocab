# GRE Vocabulary

A free, minimalist vocabulary learning app designed for GRE preparation. Built as a single HTML file with no dependencies, no accounts, and no subscriptions. Just download and start learning.

## About

Preparing for the GRE can be overwhelming, especially when you're staring at thousands of vocabulary words wondering where to start. This app was built to solve that problem. It combines 5,867 carefully curated words from popular GRE prep sources like Manhattan Prep, Barron's, and Princeton Review into one clean, distraction-free interface.

The learning system is based on the SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm — the same one that powers Anki. Instead of reviewing words randomly, the app tracks how well you know each word and schedules reviews at optimal intervals. Words you struggle with appear more frequently, while words you've mastered fade into longer review cycles. This means you spend your time where it matters most.

What makes this app a bit different is the context it provides. Each word comes with its etymology and Latin/Greek roots, helping you understand *why* words mean what they mean. There are also economics-focused example sentences (originally built for an agricultural economist, but useful for anyone who thinks in terms of markets, incentives, and policy) alongside general examples. Memory hooks and mnemonics are included to help tricky words stick.

## Features

The app offers multiple ways to learn depending on your mood and how much time you have. The classic flashcard mode lets you flip through cards at your own pace, rating each word from "Again" to "Easy" — the app calculates your next review interval automatically. If you prefer active recall, there's a typing mode where you type the word from its definition, and a matching game that pairs words with their meanings.

For those who like a challenge, timed quizzes let you race against the clock in 60-second sprints or 3-minute sessions. After any quiz, you can immediately review the words you missed, turning mistakes into focused practice.

Daily goals keep you accountable. Set targets for new words learned and reviews completed, then watch your streak grow as you show up each day. The progress dashboard shows your mastery breakdown at a glance — how many words you've mastered, how many you're still learning, and how many remain untouched.

Customization options include dark mode for late-night study sessions, adjustable text sizes for comfortable reading, and toggles to show or hide economics examples and memory hooks based on your preferences.

## How It Works

When you first open the app, you'll see your dashboard with daily goals and session options. Tap "Learn New Words" to start with fresh vocabulary, or "Review Due Words" to practice words that are ready for review based on the spaced repetition schedule.

Each flashcard shows the word on the front along with its roots and etymology. Tap to flip and reveal the definition, example sentences, and memory hook. Then rate how well you knew it: Again, Hard, Good, or Easy. The app uses your rating to schedule the next review — words marked "Again" come back in minutes, while "Easy" words might not appear for weeks.

You can also swipe on mobile: swipe left for "Again" and swipe right for "Easy" for a faster review flow.

The Browse section lets you search through all 5,867 words, filter by status (new, learning, mastered, or due), and tap any word to see its full details. From there, you can add it directly to your study session.

Your progress is saved automatically in your browser's local storage. Use the export feature to back up your data as a JSON file, or import it on another device to continue where you left off.

## Word Sources

The vocabulary database was compiled from several trusted GRE preparation resources: Barron's GRE Word List (~3,900 words), Manhattan Prep's 1000 GRE Words (~950 words), Princeton Review's Hit Parade and Word Smart collections (~500 words), and additional curated lists (~500 words). Duplicates were removed and definitions were cleaned for consistency.
